# Numerical Methods Implemented from Scratch

This repository contains a collection of various numerical methods, that are implemented in MATLAB from scratch. 
Each folder contains scripts for:
* Non-Linear Equations: Techniques for solving non-linear equations.
* Tridiagonal Matrices and Splines: Working with tridiagonal matrices and spline interpolation.
* Iterative Methods and Eigen Vectors: Approaches to solving systems of linear equations.
* Numerical Integration: Methods for performing numerical integration.
* Ordinary Differential Equations: Solutions for first-order ODEs.
* Systems of ODEs: Techniques for finding Cauchy solutions of ODE systems.
* Parabolic and Hyperbolic PDEs: (Empty yet) Methods for solving parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.
